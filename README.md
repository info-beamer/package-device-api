# Shows the values returned by the new device internal HTTP API

The next [info-beamer signage OS](https://info-beamer.com) version
will include an internal HTTP API on each device that allows querying
and modifying the state of the device by processes running on each
device.

This simple package shows all the values returned by the
`/api/v1/status` API call. Right now this is still experimental
and in the future the API will be documented on info-beamer.com.
